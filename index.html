			</div>
			<p id="subtitulo">FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>
			<div id="listas">
				<h3 class="list">SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
						youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
						coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
						detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
						technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.	
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="list">FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<span class="spanitems">DIMENSIONS.</span> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
						within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
						dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
						and older.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="spanitems">COMPETITION FIELDS. </span> Fields used within the competition program must
						be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
						participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
						field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
						Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
						field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
						dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
						associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
						required to play all their games away.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="spanitems">FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</span> 
						<ol class="interno">
							<li>
								U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
								areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.

							</li>
							<li>
								U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
							</li>
							<li>
								U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in 	width.
							</li>
							<li>
								In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
								dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="spanitems">TEAM BENCH AREAS</span> 
						<ol class="interno">
							<li>Recreation & District Programs.
								<ul>
									<li>
										The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
										be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
										bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
										away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
										both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field 
										2
										conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
										the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
										(2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
										yards one (1) way from the halfway line.
									</li>
									<li>
										The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
										locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
										to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
										and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
										the team they are supporting.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<li>
									State Competition League Only.
									<ul>
										<li>
											Except where it is determined by the referee to be
											impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
											touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
											outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
											from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
											from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
											the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
											remain within their team's bench area during the game
										</li>
										<li>
											Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
											the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
											on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
											team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
											each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
											parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
											enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
											games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
											spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
											to comply with these standards.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3 class="list">EQUIPMENT</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							We will abide by and accept equipment standards as defined by FIFA,
							USSF and USYSA.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">NUMBER OF PLAYERS</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="spanitems">TEAM SIZE.</span> Except as noted below, team rosters shall consist of not less

							seven (7) players present and able to play before referees are permitted to
							start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may
							be on the field at any one time during the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="spanitems">SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS.</span>  In order to give player’s maximum
							opportunity to develop in the game of soccer, U-6 through U-1O play
							modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
							Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
							play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
							younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
							players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)
						</li>	
						<li>
							Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers in
							the playing area are low are strongly encouraged to play small-sided
							games on reduced field size.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">SUBTITUTIONS</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Teams may make an unlimited number of substitutions at the times

					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
							the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
							third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
							the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
							received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
							which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
							This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
							during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
							next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
							participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
							deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
							(48) hours of the conclusion of the match.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">ALL-PLAY</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at
							least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are
							encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
							<ul>

									practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
									games, and injuries.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">PLAYERS’ EQUIPMENT</h3>

					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">MIXED TEAMS</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="spanitems">GIRLS PLAYING ON BOYS’ TEAMS.</span> Girls are eligible to play on boys’ teams with parent/guardian permission.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">COACHING FROM THE SIDELINES</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">GAME TERMINATION</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Any game terminated after 15 minutes into the second half by the referee
							by reason of the elements, or by reason of grave disorder on the part of
							the coaches, players or spectators of a team that is losing at the point that
							the game is terminated, shall stand as a completed game. If a team is
							ahead and the game is called because of their actions they will lose the
							game 1-0.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">CONDITIONS OF REPLAY OF GAMES</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Any game which is required to be replayed as a result of any protest or
							appeal, shall be subject to the following conditions:

								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="list">REFEREE RESPONSIBLITIES</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The referee shall verify the identity of the players and coaches with his/her
							player pass. He shall collect the passes of those players and coaches who

						</li>
						<li>
							A referee report form must be filed for every game played.
						</li>
						<li>

							the start of each game. Upon request, referees officiating at any game
							must willingly and without bias, show documentation regarding their
							certification level and registration standing with the USSF to coach,
							assistant coach, or team captain of teams participating in that game. Prior
							to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the referees do
							not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at
							a later date.
						</li>
						<li>
							Referees not complying with this section will be referred to the Disciplinary
							Committee.
